<h2> The Hounds of Zaroff</h2>

<p>"The Most Dangerous Game", also published as "The Hounds of Zaroff", is a short story by Richard Connell, first published in Collier's on January 19, 1924, with illustrations by Wilmot Emerton Heitland. The story features a big-game hunter from New York City who falls from a yacht and swims to what seems to be an abandoned and isolated island in the Caribbean, where he is hunted by a Russian aristocrat. The story is inspired by the big-game hunting safaris in Africa and South America that were particularly fashionable among wealthy Americans in the 1920 ,The story has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the 1932 RKO Pictures film The Most Dangerous Game, starring Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks and Fay Wray, and for a 1943 episode of the CBS Radio series Suspense, starring Orson Welles. It has been called the "most popular short story ever written in English." Upon its publication, it won the O. Henry Award
  "The Most Dangerous Game" is one of many works that entered the public domain in the United States in 2020  </p>

<h3> IN SHORT ABOUT THIS GAME  </h3>

<P> Animal hunter Rainford and his friend Whitney travel by ship to the Amazon jungle to chase Jaguar  </P>
There was a sharp discussion about ship trap Island, which has a bad reputation among sailors, Whitney went to his bed but Rainford kept smoking on the deck, he started hearing gunshots from afar, Rainford rushing to the railroad tracks to get a better look. Renford swims to the ship trap to find a stately mansion inhabited by two owners, General Zarf and his giant servants. 
<p>Zarlov is known as another great game hunter, Renford from his account of hunting snow leopards during dinner The middle-aged Zarlov explains that although he has been hunting animals since he was a boy, he decided to kill the animals, but it became boring after escaping the Russian revolution, he bought a ship trap, built a house for himself, and provided the island with lights to attract ships passing by the rocks that surround it.   </p>
<p>He takes the survivors in the game captive and chases them to practice sports and gives them food, clothes and a knife at the beginning of the first hours of the game and uses a small pistol, any prisoners who could elude Zarlov, Ivan and a group of dogs are released for 3 days, he reveals that he won the chase until he offers the prisoners a choice between being hunted or handed over to Ivan, who worked for the White Palace,  The slogan of the game" life for the strong"  </p>
<p> Zarlov is excited about having another life as his companion and at breakfast he offers Renford's owners with him on his next fishing trip but Renford strongly refuses and demands to leave the island, Zarlov is frustrated because he will hunt Renford, Zarlov becomes impersonal Zarlov impersonal and sets standards for the game as he would for any captive sailor Renford reluctantly agrees to the terms and receives his equipment from Ivan 
</p>

<p> At first, Renford lays down a complicated trail in the woods and then climbs a tree, but Zarlov easily finds it, but decides to play with him as if it were a cat with a mouse. Suddenly, after a failed attempt to fight with Zarlov, a Malay man hunter builds a weighted record associated with an operator. This strange tool hits Zarlov's shoulder slightly, causing him to return home, but he screams his respect for the trap before leaving. The next day, Renford created a Burmese tiger hole that kills one of the Zarlov hounds and hounds that approach him or dive. Renford escapes and returns home frustrated by Renford's apparent suicide 
  Zarlov smokes a pipe near the fireplace, but there are two problems that prevent him from achieving peace of mind; the difficulty of replacing Ivan and not realizing that once Rainford has died while diving, Zarlov locks himself in sleep, turning on the lights to find Renford waiting for him, who swam to sneak into the palace without being found by the dogs, and after asking for the palace, he killed Zarlov. 
  And this is the building of this most dangerous game that it does not make the player addicted to trying to kill and doing bad habits
