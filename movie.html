    ,When a British soldier returns home from Kyiv, he joins an old friend in working as contract killers. His disturbed past surfaces as he spins out of control during jobs and ominous employers raise the stakes. It was filmed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire in England
</p>
<P> Jay and Gal are two former British soldiers turned hitmen. While Gal is laid-back, Jay is still reeling from an unspecified disastrous mission in Kyiv. Despite the urging of his wife Shel, Jay has not obtained full employment, to the point where they are financially broke,
    Shel organizes a dinner party to which she invites Gal and his latest girlfriend, Fiona, a human resources manager. During the evening, Gal reveals he has a new job for them, which Shel encourages him to take. Meanwhile, Fiona goes to the toilet, carves a symbol on the back of the bathroom mirror, and takes a tissue that Jay had used to mop up his blood after a shaving accident. Jay accepts the job, and the two meet the shadowy client, who has a list of three people he wants killed. The employer unexpectedly cuts Jay's hand and his own, so that the contract is effectively signed in blood.
